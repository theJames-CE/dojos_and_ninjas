<h1>Assignment: Dojos and Ninjas</h1>

<b>Learning Objectives:</b><br>

<li>Students will design an ERD using one-to-many relationships.</li><br>

<b>Welcome to another Core assignment!</b> Some students like to explore the assignments before they're finished reading through the lessons, and that's okay! It can be good for your brain to have a preview of what your future challenges might be. However, before you begin this assignment, it's important that you've first:<br>

<li>Completed the preceding lesson modules</li>
<li>Taken the knowledge checks to confirm your understanding</li>
<li>Viewed lecture material related to the assignment topics</li>
<li>Completed and submitted your practice assignments</li><br>

<h2>Now, the Assignment:</h2>

Imagine that you're a developer working at Coding Dojo, and you need to create an ERD to represent the database of students and the Dojo location at which they're enrolled.<br><br><br><br>



<b>Your Task:</b> Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks dojos, as well as the ninjas that belong to each dojo location.<br>

Each dojo should have an id, name, created_at and updated_at; each ninja should have an id, first_name, last_name, age, created_at, updated_at and belong to a specific dojo. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.<br>
